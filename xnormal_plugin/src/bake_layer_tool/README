IMPORTANT:

This tool/plugin is still in beta, and at the moment, I am
still trying to acquire node IDs from Autodesk.  Because of
this, maya files using the bake layer nodes will break upon
upgrading to a version of this tool 1.0+.  I will attempt to
write a tool to fix broken .ma files (.mb, you're on your
own) once this happens, but I cannot guarantee it will
happen.

Thanks for Testing!

To Install/run:

> Copy the bake_layer_tool and all contents to your 
  <Documents>/maya/<version>/scripts Directory
  
> Open maya, and in the Command Line or script editor,
  execute the following lines of Python:
  
  import bake_layer_tool
  bake_layer_tool.setup( )
  
> This should create a new shelf.  To work with bake Layers,
  either click the "BLE" button in this new shelf, or input
  the following line of Python in either the script editor
  or the command line:
  
  bake_layer_tool.bake_layer_window.BakeLayerWindow( )
