git repo Readme:

This repo holds an eclipse project, and thus contains several folders which
you do not need to run the script.  To install the script for use (not 
development), only use the folders below 'xnormal_pluginsrc/'.  Instructions 
for installation are located in 'xnormal_plugin/src/'.
